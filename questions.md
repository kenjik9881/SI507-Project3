â€¢ IMPORTANT NOTE: We may test your code on a version of gallery.html that has different alt-text. For example, it may be that the 8th image is missing alt text and the 7th image has the alt text "Waving Kitty 7", OR the first 3 images will be missing alt text, and the fourth image will have the alt-text "Waving Kitty 1"... There will still be 10 images, no matter what. You will receive 20 points for each correct alt text output.----what does this means?
